            <p>I'm someone who learns by observing and builds by thinking.</p>
            <p>I don't rush ideas I let them settle</p>
            <p>because I like building things that feel human!</p>

            <h2>How I think</h2>
            <p>good design doesn't demand attention all the time</p>
            <p>some ideas feel old because they are human</p>
            <p>there were so many ideas on my todo list that choosing what to do first took more time than doing the entire list</p>
            <p>I sometimes wish I could clone myself so that they would finish all my ideas</p>
            <p>I wonder if people see me as chaos or calm</p>
            <p>sometimes thinking about what to do feels like doing nothing at all.</p>
            <p>I finally began and can't stop now</p>
            <p>time disappears when I'm deep in this, why didn't I start sooner?</p>
            <p>Lastly, I think there's something magical about finally turning an idea into action</p>

        <section id="gratitude">
            <h2>Grateful</h2>
            <p>I am grateful for people and ideas that make me better</p>
            <p>This space exists because someone once made me feel seen and that makes me immensely grateful</p>
